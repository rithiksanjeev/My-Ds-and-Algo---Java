1) Two sum

1 2 3 4 5 6
target =10

by picking any two elements check if the target is 10

2) Three sum
by picking any three elements check if the target is 10

3) convert a number from decimal to binary

4) convert a binary number to decimal

5) Generate subsequence of a array (try using concept of binary) -> combinations need to print

6) Wave traversal of Matrix (down up down up) in row also

7) Given an integer array => form the number

8) Given an integer (123112313) and a target dig (always one dig) calculate its frequencey

9) sum of two arrays (by forming the number) //make sure the ans should be in array

1 2 3 => A =123
4 4 5 => B =446 : sum = a+b; store back into array

10) form the reverse of a number (Note :- not allowed to use array) A= 12345 B= 54321
